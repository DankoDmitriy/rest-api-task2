#Task
This module is an extension of REST API Advanced module and covers following topics:

Spring Security framework
Oauth2 and OpenId Connect
JWT token
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. OAuth 2.0 is a security standard where you give one application permission to access your data in another application. The steps to grant permission, or consent, are often referred to as authorization or even delegated authorization. You authorize one application to access your data, or use features in another application on your behalf, without giving them your password. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a thin layer that sits on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds login and profile information about the person who is logged in. JSON Web Tokens are JSON objects used to send information between parties in a compact and secure manner.
